 * MAIN file --> main
 * Name --> Antara Ibnath
 * Email ---> antara.ibnath08@myhunter.cuny.edu
 * This main file is to test for GameItem class
 * Date --> 2025-06-10
 *  I wanted to make it clear, I used W3SCHOOLS a online website that teaches
 *  programming languages
 * as a refrence/ medium to study / if i had issues with my logic
 * 
 * Since there wasnt a concrete list of items that we need to include I based my main on my favorite game SIMS 4, 
 * they had a feature where sims can dig for different crystals throughout the different worlds
 * and sims can collect them, and they have different rarities, weights, and values, and sell them if they want.
 * I tested all enum values based on the difernt crystals you can find
 * 
 * I tested both programs on the same main since my computer will override 2 mains
